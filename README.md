## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ npm start
```

Now you can edit the files in the `scripts` folder and see the changes in the console everytime you save.

## TODO

- [x] this should also work for javascript
- [ ] improve and pretty print errors (maybe with https://github.com/unjs/consola)
  - [ ] syntax errors
  - [ ] runtime errors
- [ ] create `playground-react`
