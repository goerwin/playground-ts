## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ npm start
```

Now you can create or modify Typescript and Javascript files (`*.ts`, `*.js`) in the `scripts` folder and see the console log changes in the Terminal everytime you save.

## TODO

- [x] this should also work for javascript
- [x] improve and pretty print errors (maybe with https://github.com/unjs/consola)
  - [x] syntax errors
  - [x] runtime errors
